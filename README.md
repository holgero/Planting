# Planting
Valheim mod that helps planting crops in correct distance from surroundings and other crops.

## REQUIREMENTS

## FEATURES
* Avoid the 'needs more room to grow' message by making it impossible to place crops too close

## INSTALLATION
After download and extraction put the file `Planting.dll` into the plugins folder of BepInEx.

## CONFIGURATION
On the first run the plugin creates a configuration file named

with a text editor to configure the mod.
But currently there is no configurable value in there.
